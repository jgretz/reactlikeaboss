# React To Reality
You were inspired by the talks, finished the training, and built a few CRUD apps in React. You're feeling confident in your new skills - ready to conquer the world (or at least the next project). The moment that project arrives though, you are faced by the monumental task of applying your bright, shiny React skills to a complex legacy domain with millions of records - what to do? How do you craft maintainable, readable code while keeping your sanity?

This session will tackle this real world problem head on. It will cover how to use Redux, various middleware, and tooling to create a safe, performant container to store the data. It will then discuss how to clearly and concisely manipulate and search that container using packages like ImmutableJS and Reselect. The talk will conclude by demonstrating how to attractively render large sets of data via React-Virtualized.

So don't cower in the face of the challenge - come, see, and conquer reality.
